Hey Jimbo,

 I spoke with the gang. The heist has been planned. Frist we need to get our hands on a bulldozer. Then we are going to use it to pull all the ATMs in town our of their walls. Muddy is going to hand the bulldozer over to Bert at the secret location. The details are hidden. Make sure everyone is ready for it!
